                Ever wonder what an ametour programmer thinks about society? No?
                Oh
                well I might aswell tell you. In all seriousness would love to
                keep
                you updated on my progress in coding. I will attempt to post
                here
                about once a week, with varying article lengths. I dont plan to
                stick to much of a "Format" In terms of structure.
                Enough introductions, I hope you enjoy! </p>

        <h3 style="color: black; font-size: 30px">Coding</h3>
        <p>Ahhh coding, the classical laungauge of the geeks. From sql to python
            and Jquery coding can seem to go on forever. As a begginer(like my 
            self)
            coding can be one of the hardest skills you will come across. The
            common pit falls that many people who want to learn programmign face
            is the starting fallacy.
            This takes many forms, the most common ones are the classical "What
            language do I learn?" or the ever present "What bootcamp/curriculum
            should I use?".
            Unfortunately this is very hard to extinguish in coding pupils
            because their are so many different paths and languages in coding.
            People have heated debates over which language is better for
            begginers to learn. "Java"
            script is the devils tounge" I hear dev's say; Front-end is more
            intuitive. Keep reading for my solution.

        </p>
        <h3 style="color: black; font-size: 30px">My solution</h3>
        <p><strong>If you cant read this section here is the TLDR:</strong> Pick
            a bootcamp and stick to it. So as unorthadox as this may seem
            In practice this is very affective, the starting language you choose
            does not really matter as long as it has a known syntax and
            documentation
            what matters is <em>motivation</em> to learn. People that constantly
            switch bootcamps dont learn or retain any information beacause when
            they switch bootcamps
            , they leave their previous knowledge with them. Another note: Do
            not pay for a coding bootcamp. Many people may furiously disagree
            with me and thats ok. But I strongly belive
            that learning with a freebootcamp will teach you how to seach for
            information more effiecently. These are the skills that real
            front/back end developers will accaully use. Now I will now admit
            something embarrasing
            . I PAID FOR CODECADEMY PRO. There. I said it. From my expirence
            with it i can tell you it is simply not worth it when compared to
            Free boot camps like<a style="color: black; background-color:

                The Odin Project </a>are far more in depth and life-like. The
            Odin Project is a comprehensive guide in the world of programming
            and I highly
            reccomend it to any aspiring developers. Another great resource is<a

            to fund your "motivation-bank" and push you to complete hundreds of
            ours of programming lessons.
